US-001 completed (E2E infrastructure only):
- Added temp project fixture helper: `e2e/helpers/projectFixture.ts`
- Added global write guard snapshot/assertion for `~/.config/notionflow`
- Added E2E usage test: `e2e/local-project-helpers.test.ts`
- Verified: `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/local-project-helpers.test.ts` passes
- Note: `npm run check` currently fails due pre-existing implicit-any issues in existing `e2e/factories/*.ts` files not touched in this task

US-002 completed (E2E init scaffold validation):
- Added `init` CLI command: `src/commands/init.ts`
- Wired `init` subcommand into CLI: `src/cli.ts`
- Added E2E test: `e2e/local-project-init.test.ts`
- Test validates `notionflow.config.ts`, `factories/`, and `.notionflow/` are created
- Test validates `.gitignore` contains exactly one `.notionflow/` entry after running `init` twice
- Test validates no writes under `~/.config/notionflow` during init flow
- Verified: `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/local-project-init.test.ts` passes
