Hard-Reset Library-First Cleanup Progress:
- Branch: ralph/hard-reset-library-first-cleanup
- Source PRD: tasks/prd-hard-reset-library-first-cleanup.md
- Status: in progress
- Completed: US-001 Clean up CLI surface for hard-reset onboarding
- Notes:
  - Updated CLI description to library-first project-local positioning.
  - Removed `setup`, `config`, and `board` from top-level CLI command registration.
  - Removed legacy deprecation/migration-guidance helper and associated command messaging.
  - Updated CLI integration tests to assert removed commands return unknown-command errors.
  - Updated `tasks/prd-hard-reset-library-first-cleanup.md` and `tasks/prd.json` to require hard removal (no migration/deprecation path).
  - Verification passed: `npm run check` and `npm run test`.
