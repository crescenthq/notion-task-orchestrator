US-001 completed (E2E infrastructure only):
- Added temp project fixture helper: `e2e/helpers/projectFixture.ts`
- Added global write guard snapshot/assertion for `~/.config/notionflow`
- Added E2E usage test: `e2e/local-project-helpers.test.ts`
- Verified: `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/local-project-helpers.test.ts` passes
- Note: `npm run check` currently fails due pre-existing implicit-any issues in existing `e2e/factories/*.ts` files not touched in this task

US-002 completed (E2E init scaffold validation):
- Added `init` CLI command: `src/commands/init.ts`
- Wired `init` subcommand into CLI: `src/cli.ts`
- Added E2E test: `e2e/local-project-init.test.ts`
- Test validates `notionflow.config.ts`, `factories/`, and `.notionflow/` are created
- Test validates `.gitignore` contains exactly one `.notionflow/` entry after running `init` twice
- Test validates no writes under `~/.config/notionflow` during init flow
- Verified: `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/local-project-init.test.ts` passes

US-003 completed (E2E doctor nested config discovery):
- Added project config walk-up helper: `src/project/discoverConfig.ts`
- Updated `doctor` command to resolve nearest `notionflow.config.ts` and print resolved `Project root` and `Config path`: `src/commands/doctor.ts`
- Removed `doctor` dependency on `openApp()` to avoid global runtime writes for this flow
- Added E2E test: `e2e/local-project-doctor.test.ts`
- Test validates `doctor` run from nested directory resolves ancestor project root/config path
- Test validates no writes under `~/.config/notionflow` during init + doctor scenario
- Verified: `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/local-project-doctor.test.ts` passes
- Note: `npm run check` still fails due pre-existing implicit-any issues in `e2e/factories/*.ts` files not touched in this task

US-004 completed (E2E factory create in local project):
- Updated `factory create` to resolve local project context via `notionflow.config.ts` and scaffold to `<project>/factories/<id>.ts`: `src/commands/factory.ts`
- Removed global runtime dependency from `factory create` path so command no longer requires `openApp()`/global DB writes for scaffold flow
- Added E2E test: `e2e/local-project-factory-create.test.ts`
- Test validates `factory create --id smoke --skip-notion-board` creates `factories/smoke.ts` in temp project
- Test validates no writes under `~/.config/notionflow` during init + factory create scenario
- Verified: `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/local-project-factory-create.test.ts` passes

US-005 completed (project context resolver + `--config` override):
- Added shared resolver with explicit config-path validation/normalization and actionable error context: `src/project/discoverConfig.ts`
- Updated `doctor` to use shared resolver and support `--config <path>` with clear start/attempted path diagnostics: `src/commands/doctor.ts`
- Updated `factory create` to use shared resolver and support `--config <path>` from outside project roots: `src/commands/factory.ts`
- Extended E2E doctor coverage for walk-up, explicit `--config` override, and missing-config non-zero failures with contextual error output: `e2e/local-project-doctor.test.ts`
- Extended E2E factory-create coverage for `--config` execution from outside the project root: `e2e/local-project-factory-create.test.ts`
- Verified: `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/local-project-doctor.test.ts e2e/local-project-factory-create.test.ts` passes
- Note: `npm run check` still fails due pre-existing implicit-any issues in `e2e/factories/*.ts` files not touched in this task

US-006 completed (explicit factory declarations and deterministic loader primitives):
- Added typed project config schema/loader with explicit `factories: string[]` declarations and actionable config-load errors: `src/project/projectConfig.ts`
- Added deterministic factory path resolution from config entries (relative-to-project-root or absolute) with no implicit glob/directory scanning: `src/project/projectConfig.ts`
- Added declared-factory loading helper that only loads explicitly listed modules and wraps per-path failures with offending declaration context: `src/project/projectConfig.ts`
- Added unit tests for explicit path resolution and non-scanning behavior with unlisted invalid factory files present: `src/project/projectConfig.test.ts`
- Verified: `npm run test -- src/project/projectConfig.test.ts` passes
- Note: `npm run check` still fails due pre-existing implicit-any issues in `e2e/factories/*.ts` files not touched in this task

US-007 completed (fail-fast invalid declarations and duplicate IDs):
- Added explicit missing-file guard for declared factory paths with clear declared/resolved path diagnostics before module load: `src/project/projectConfig.ts`
- Added duplicate factory-id detection in declared-factory loader with conflicting ID plus first/duplicate declaration and resolved path context: `src/project/projectConfig.ts`
- Added unit coverage for missing declared path errors and duplicate factory-id failures across declared files: `src/project/projectConfig.test.ts`
- Verified: `npm run test -- src/project/projectConfig.test.ts` passes
- Note: `npm run check` still fails due pre-existing implicit-any issues in `e2e/factories/*.ts` files not touched in this task
