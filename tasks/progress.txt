2026-02-27 — TSK-001: CLI reduction and factory-first naming
- Added new top-level `factory` command group with `install`, `create`, and `list` in `src/commands/factory.ts`.
- Removed top-level `executor` and `workflow` command groups from CLI registration in `src/cli.ts`.
- Updated user-facing command/help text to use `factory` terminology in `setup`, `run`, `tick`, and Notion integration command args (`--factory`).
- Rewrote README command examples around `factory` operations.
- Verified with `npm run check` and `npx tsx src/cli.ts factory --help`.
