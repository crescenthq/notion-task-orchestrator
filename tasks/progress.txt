- Branch: ralph/hard-reset-library-first-cleanup
- Source PRD: tasks/prd-hard-reset-library-first-cleanup.md
- Status: in progress
- Completed: US-001 Clean up CLI surface for hard-reset onboarding
- Notes:
  - Updated CLI description to library-first project-local positioning.
  - Reclassified `setup`, `config`, and `board` commands as legacy in help text.
  - Added explicit deprecation guidance toward `init -> factory create -> doctor -> tick` when legacy commands run.
  - Updated CLI integration tests and command categorization tests for new onboarding/deprecation behavior.
  - Verification passed: `npm run check` and `npm run test`.
